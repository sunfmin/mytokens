# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub issues in its **tracker** (control ADR 0002): the repo whose issues the fleet of this checkout works. Whose issues a fleet works is a fact of its host, never pushed, so this file names no tracker: ask the host. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Find the tracker

```sh
afkconvoy checkouts | jq -rn --arg root "$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")" \
  'input | if .error then error(.error) else [.checkouts[] | select(.checkout == $root) | .tracker][0] // "none" end'
```

It prints the `tracker` that `afkconvoy checkouts` answers for this checkout, whose entry is its main worktree's: the fleet reads it the same way from any worktree of it. Two cases, which differ only in the repo label:

- **It names a tracker**, `<owner>/<repo>`: the issues are there, among other repos' issues. This repo's carry its **repo label**, `repo:sunfmin/mytokens`. An issue there without it is no issue of this repo, and no fleet works it.
- **It prints `none`**: the checkout's entry says no tracker, or the checkout is on no checkout list of this host. The tracker is this repo itself, and no repo label is used. An issue here that carries a repo label is the issue of the repo that label names, not this one's.

Where it fails instead, `afkconvoy checkouts` gave no answer, and the tracker is unknown: open, list and change no issue until it answers.

Below, `<tracker>` is the tracker it names, or this repo, as its `origin` remote names it.

## Conventions

Every operation on an issue goes to the tracker: put `--repo <tracker>` on each `gh issue` command below, and `repos/<tracker>` in each `gh api` path of an issue. Run in the checkout without it, `gh` acts on this repo's own issue of that number.

The tracker refuses a label it lacks, on a new issue or an old one: where `gh label list --repo <tracker>` does not have a label a skill asks for (`needs-triage`, `epic`, `wayfinder:map`, …), make it first with `gh label create <label> --repo <tracker>`.

- **Create an issue**: run `afkconvoy flows` in the checkout, once for all the issues you open. Its `line` (`flows --help`) opens an issue in the tracker, with the repo label where the tracker is another repo. The tracker is the one this host's checkout list says; in a checkout the list does not hold (another account, a fresh clone) `flows` refuses until `--tracker <owner>/<repo>` names it. Give it a title and a body file. The ready label on that line hands the issue to the fleet: for an issue not ready to be worked (`needs-triage`, an epic, a wayfinder map), put the label the skill asks for in its place, and keep `--repo` and the repo label.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --repo <tracker> --json number,title,body,labels,comments`.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --repo <tracker> --label repo:sunfmin/mytokens --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters. Where the tracker is this repo, leave out `--label repo:sunfmin/mytokens`.
- **Make an issue a sub-issue of a parent**: `--parent <parent>` on the create line, or `gh issue edit <parent> --repo <tracker> --add-sub-issue <child>` afterwards (`gh` 2.94+). Older `gh`: `gh api --method POST repos/<tracker>/issues/<parent>/sub_issues -F sub_issue_id=<child-db-id>` (database id, as in **Blocking** below). Without sub-issues, put `Part of #<parent>` at the top of the child body.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --repo <tracker> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --repo <tracker> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --repo <tracker> --comment "..."`
- **Blocking**: GitHub's **native issue dependencies** between the tracker's issues, the canonical, UI-visible representation. Add an edge with `gh api --method POST repos/<tracker>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`, where `<blocker-db-id>` is the blocker's numeric **database id** (`gh api repos/<tracker>/issues/<n> --jq .id`, _not_ the `#number` or `node_id`). Read each blocker's own `state` from the dependency edges (`dependencies/blocked_by`, or GraphQL `blockedBy { nodes { number state } }`): `issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by` can stay stale after a blocker closes and must not decide blocking. Where dependencies aren't available, fall back to a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line at the top of the child body. A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.

## Naming an issue

In the tracker, in an issue's body or comment, `#<n>` is the tracker's issue `<n>`. In this repo, in a PR, a commit or a doc, `#<n>` alone is this repo's own issue or PR: name a tracker's issue `<tracker>#<n>`, and close one from a PR with `Closes <tracker>#<n>`.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

PRs are this repo's, never the tracker's: run `gh pr` in the checkout, with no `--repo`. When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh api --paginate 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=open' --jq '.[] | select(.author_association | IN("OWNER","MEMBER","COLLABORATOR") | not) | {number, title, author: .user.login, author_association, labels: [.labels[].name]}'`.
- **Comment / label / close**: `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit --add-label`/`--remove-label`, `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across a repo's issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` in this repo may be either, and both are this repo's own: resolve with `gh pr view 42` and fall back to `gh issue view 42`, both with no `--repo`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create an issue in the tracker, as in **Create an issue** above.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read it as in **Read an issue** above.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets, all in the tracker.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body: the create line with `--label wayfinder:map` in place of the ready label.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue (see **Make an issue a sub-issue of a parent**). Where sub-issues aren't enabled, add the child to a task list in the map body and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body. Labels: `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`). Once claimed, the ticket is assigned to the driving dev.
- **Blocking**: as in **Blocking** above.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children (as in **List issues**, scoped to the map's sub-issues / task list), drop any with an open blocker (a blocker's own state is open, including issues in a fallback `Blocked by` line) or an assignee; first in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --repo <tracker> --add-assignee @me`, the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: `gh issue comment <n> --repo <tracker> --body "<answer>"`, then `gh issue close <n> --repo <tracker>`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far.
